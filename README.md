## Quick Start

If you get stuck at all, check out the [docs](docs/) for more information.

### 1. Fork & Clone

Fork this repo, then clone your fork.

### 2. Rename Files

```bash
mv .env.example .env
mv docs/COMPANIES_TEMPLATE.md docs/COMPANIES.md
```

### 3. Setup Database ([Neon](https://neon.com))

Run the following SQL:

```sql
CREATE TABLE companies (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    company TEXT NOT NULL,
    link TEXT NOT NULL,
    platform TEXT NOT NULL,
    UNIQUE(id, company, link, platform)
);

CREATE TABLE seen (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    company TEXT NOT NULL,
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    link TEXT NOT NULL,
    date TEXT NOT NULL,
    UNIQUE(id, company, title, link, date)
);

CREATE TABLE elements (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    platform TEXT NOT NULL,
    jobs_element TEXT,
    titles_element TEXT,
    links_element TEXT,
    UNIQUE(id, platform, jobs_element, titles_element, links_element)
);
```

### 4. Setup Discord Webhook

* Create a channel (e.g. `first-responder`)
* Create a webhook

### 5. Add Environment Variables

Add the db connection string and webhook URL to the `.env` file:

```env
DISCORD_WEBHOOK = ""
DATABASE_URL = ""
```

Do the same for GitHub Action Secrets:

```env
DISCORD_WEBHOOK
DATABASE_URL
```

### 6. Run Locally To Test

```bash
uv sync
uv run playwright install
uv run main.py
```

## Filtering Jobs

Edit:

```
filter/filters.py
```

* `allow`: job keywords you want
* `deny`: job keywords you don’t want

> Tip: include variations like `junior`, `jr`, `jr.`

## Adding Companies

Use `docs/companies.md` to track company career pages.

Quick ways to find them:

* Workday → `site:wd1.myworkdayjobs.com`
* Ashby → `site:jobs.ashbyhq.com`
* Greenhouse → `site:job-boards.greenhouse.io`

You can bulk insert using a generated SQL statement, or add them one by one in the Neon console.

> Tip: I suggest using this file to make a big list first, bulk insert into the Neon database, then use it to keep a local track of companies and add new ones directly in the Neon console.

## Future Plans

* Smarter filtering using an LLM (job description matching)
* Local-first mode (local LLM + database)
* Better configurability
